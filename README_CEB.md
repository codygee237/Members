This repository is meant for all organizational matters, like:
- defining how we work together
- how to become a coop Member
- how to earn RHOC
- etc.

The [issues](https://github.com/rchain/Members/issues) in this repository 
are the basis of an emerging [market of RChain contributor work](CONTRIBUTING.md).
Not just code: [Marketing - Content Curation, Creation and Outreach][comm] 
and any other ways to support the coop are welcome.
